    <p>Designing a user-friendly API for a Probabilistic Programming Language (PPLs) is
cursed by the deceiving simplicity of the mathematical representation of
graphical models. Take a simple Beta-Binomial model:</p>
<pre><code>p ~ Beta(1, 2)
b ~ Binomial(p)
</code></pre><p>Looking at these equations you are able to comprehend what they represent, and
their consequences. But these equations are only <em>descriptive</em>, they do not allow us to
compute anything. To manipulate these models in a useful way we need to extract
at least two different representations of this object: one that draws samples
form the prior joint distribution, and the log-probability density function. We
have a one-to-many relationship between the notation and what we need from it in
practice, and this one-to-many relationship is not trivial to implement in
programming languages.</p>
<p>Of course we can implement these two representations separately. This is simple to do
with &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; distributions like the Beta, Dirichlet, Multivariate Normal,
etc. distributions. As a matter of fact, they are often implemented as a single object that
implements a <code>sample</code> and a <code>logpdf</code> method. So when you write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Beta(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1.</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">1.</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>You can draw realizations from this random variable with <code>x.sample()</code> or compute
the log-probability of x having the value <code>a</code> as <code>x.logpdf(a)</code>. The notation
mirrors that of <code>x ~ Beta(1., 1.)</code>.</p>
<p>But it becomes more tedious with complex graphical models. You can always
implement each model as a class, say <code>BetaBinomial</code> for the Beta-Binomial model
above. But then you are building a model zoo, not a language in which the models
can be expressed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">regression</span>(X):
  alpha <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Normal(<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>)
  beta <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Normal(np<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>zeros(<span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>), <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>)
  sigma <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> HalfNormal(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
  
  y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> alpha <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> np<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>dot(beta, X)
  predictions <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Normal(y, sigma)
  
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> predictions
</code></pre></div><p>What we would like is a language that allows us to manipulate random variables,
write models as functions of these variables. And once the model is defined, to
be able to sample from its joint prior and posterior distributions. At the very
least, it should give you a sampling function and a function that computes the
log-probability for every position in the state-space. That is what
probabilistic programming is about.</p>
<p>We would like a language that allows us to combine such elementary
distributions, just like above, into an object that gives us its logpdf and
sampling distribution. If we can do that, we can express any model that is a
combination of these elementary distributions, sample from its prior and
posterior distribution. That&rsquo;s what probabilistic programming is about.</p>
<p>But programming languages are different: one set of instructions does one thing
and only one. I can probably write a programme like the one above that would
give me predictive samples. But then I wouldn’t have the logpdf. There is thus a
tension between the mathematical notations and the programming language.</p>
<p>This is a problem of two languages: how do you express in a programming language
an abstract way of defining models?</p>
<p>In practice PPLs have different ways to resolve this tension: some build a
graph, some use effect handlers (I recommend Junpeng&rsquo;s <a href="">talk at PyCordoba</a> on
PPLs). MCX&rsquo;s stance is much like Stan&rsquo;s: what if we created our own language,
close to the mathematical expression, that can then be compiled in a logpdf and
a sampling function?</p>
<p>Unlike Stan, MCX is embedded in Python. We would like to benefit from Python&rsquo;s
automatic differentiation, acceleration and array manipulation libraries. We
would also like to integrate with Python&rsquo;s still budding machine learning
ecosystem. MCX should thus be a superset a python: allow every operation python
allows, but somehow accomodate random variable assignments. Having posed the
problem in these terms there is only one solution: defining a new syntax and
modify this syntax at runtime using Python&rsquo;s introspection abilities.</p>
<p>You want to reason about an abstract object, the model, without having to
interact with it at a higher level. You want to be able to &ldquo;sample from its
posterior distribution&rdquo;, &ldquo;sample from its prior predictive distribution&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="mcx-models">MCX models</h1>
<p>Without further waiting, here’s how you express the beta-binomial model in MCX:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#a6e22e">@mcx.model</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">beta_binomial</span>(beta<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>):
  a <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;~</span> Beta(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, beta)
  b <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;~</span> Binomial(a)
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> b
</code></pre></div><p>The model is syntactically close to both the mathematical notation and that of a
standard python function. Notice the <code>&lt;~</code> operator, which is not standard python
notation. It stands for &ldquo;random variable&rdquo; assignment in MCX.</p>
<p>MCX models are defined as <em>generative functions</em>. Like any function, MCX model
can be parametrized by passing arguments to the model. <code>beta_binomial</code> takes
<code>beta</code> as an argument, which can later be used to parametrize the model. It can
also take data as arguments, such as the values of predictive features in a
regression model. The <code>return</code> statement defines the model&rsquo;s output, which is a
measured variable.</p>
<p>When you write a MCX model such as the one above you
implicitely define 2 distributions. First the joint probability distribution of
the associated graphical model. You can sample from this distribution with the
<code>mcx.sample_joint(beta_binomial)</code> function. You can also the log-probability for
a set of values of is random variables with <code>mcx.log_prob(model)</code>.</p>
<p>What happens when you call this function? Under the hood MCX parses the content
of your model into an intermediate representation, which is a mix between a
graphical model (which is the mathematical object your model describes) and an
abstract syntax tree (to maintain control flow). Random variables are identified
as well as their distributions and the other variables they depend on.</p>
<p>Writing a model as a function is intuitive: most bayesian models are generative models. Given input values and parameters they return other values that can be
observed. While MCX models also represent a distribution, in the API we treat them first as generative functions.</p>
<h1 id="interacting-with-mcx-models">Interacting with MCX models</h1>
<p>Consider the following linear regression model:</p>
<pre><code>@mcx.model
def linear_regression(x, lmba=1.):
    scale &lt;~ Exponential(lmbda)
    coef &lt;~ Normal(np.zeros(x.shape[-1]), 1)
    y = np.dot(x, coef)
    preds &lt;~ Normal(y, scale)
    return preds
</code></pre><p>Calling the generative function should return a different value each time it is
called with a different value of <code>rng_key</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; linear_regression(rng_key, x)
2.3
</code></pre><p>Note the apparition of <code>rng_key</code> between the definition and the call here,
necessary because of JAX&rsquo;s pseudo-random number generation system. It can be
cumbersome to specify a different <code>rng_key</code> at each call so we can handle the
splitting automatically using:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fn = mcx.seed(linear_regression, rng_key)
&gt;&gt;&gt; fn(10)
34.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; fn(10)
52.1
</code></pre><p><code>linear_regression</code> is a regular function so we can use JAX&rsquo;s vmap construct to
obtain a fixed number of samples from the prior predictive distribution.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; keys = jax.random.split(rng_key, num_samples)
&gt;&gt;&gt; jax.vmap(linear_regression, in_axes=(0, None))(keys, x_data)
</code></pre><p>Again, for convenience, we provide a <code>sample_predictive</code> function, which draws
samples from the function&rsquo;s predictive distribution.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mcx.sample_predictive(linear_regression, (x_data,), num_samples=1000)
</code></pre><p>The generative function implicitly defines a multivariate distribution over the
model&rsquo;s random variables. We include utilities to sample from this distribution.
To sample from the prior distribution:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sampler = mcx.sample_joint(rng_key, linear_regression, (x_data,))
</code></pre><p>Since forward sampling can be an efficient way to debug a model, we also
introduce a convenient <code>forward</code> method to the model:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; linear_regression.forward(rng_key, x_data)
</code></pre><p>If you have seeded the model as shown before (recommended when debugging), then
you can call</p>
<pre><code>linear_regression.forward(x_data)
</code></pre><p>To sample from the posterior distribution we need to specify which variables
we are conditioning the distribution on (the observed variables) and the
kernel we use to sample from the posterior:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sampler = mcx.sampler(
...               rng_key,
...               linear_regression, 
...               (x_data,),
...               {'preds': y_data},
...               HMC(100),
...           )
... sampler.run(1000)
</code></pre><p>Once the model&rsquo;s posterior distribution has been sampled we can define a new
generative function that is the original function evaluated at the samples from
the posterior distribution.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; evaluated_model = mcx.evaluate(linear_regression, trace)
</code></pre><p>When sampling from the predictive distribution, instead of drawing a value for
each variable from its prior distribution, we sample one position of the chains
and compute the function&rsquo;s output. Apart from this we can draw samples from
the generative distribution like we would the model:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; evaluated_model(rng_key, x_data)
&gt;&gt;&gt; seeded = mcx.seed(evaluated_model, rng_key)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mcx.sample_predictive(rng_key, evaluate_model, (x_data,), num_samples=100)
</code></pre><p>Unlike the original model, however, the evaluated program is not a distribution.
It is a generative function for which only predictive distributions are defined.</p>
<h2 id="go-on-your-own">Go on your own</h2>
<p>MCX provides a convenient interface to interact with the model&rsquo;s predictive,
joint prior and posterior distributions, but should you want to build something
more sophisticated you can always access the underlying functions directly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># Get the function that computes the logprobability</span>
log_prob(model)
<span style="color:#75715e"># Get a function that draws one sample from the joint distributon</span>
joint_sampler(model)
<span style="color:#75715e"># Function that draws one sample from the predictive distribution</span>
predictive_sampler(model)
</code></pre></div><p>Which should get you covered for most of your applications. <code>log_prob</code>, in
particular, allows to you to write your model with MCX and use another library
(e.g. BlackJAX) to sample from the posterior distribution.</p>
<h1 id="graph-as-in-graphical-model">&lsquo;Graph&rsquo; as in Graphical model</h1>
<p>The models' graph can be accessed interactively. It can be changed in place. It is possible to set the value of one node and see how it impacts the others, very useful to debug without re-writing the whole in scipy!</p>
<pre><code>new_graph = simplify_conjugacy(graph)
</code></pre><p>Having a graph is wonderful: it means that you can symbolically manipulate your
model. You can detect conjugacies and using conjugate distibution to optimize
sampling, reparametrization is trivial to do, etc. Manipulating the graph is
pretty much akin to manipulating the mathematical object.</p>
<pre><code>                                       +----&gt; logpdf
  @mcx.model                           |
  def my_model(X):   -----&gt;   Graph  -------&gt; ....
      .....                            |
      return y                         +----&gt; forward_sampler 

</code></pre><p>All this happens in <em>pure python</em>, there is no framework involved. We do use
NetworkX to build and manipulate graphs for convenience, but could do without.</p>
<p>Currently the graph we compile is a static graph. It only contains the random
variables and transformation. As such it can only handle a fixed number of
random variables. This, however, is a strong</p>
<p>The advantage of compiling pure python function is that it nicely decouples the
modeling language from inference. Any inference library that accepts python
functions (with jax constructs) could use the functions used by the DSL. So far
the entire code only relies on functions in JAX that are present in numpy/scipy.
So you could very well consider this as a numpy/scipy function. And if you were
introduce JAX-specific constructs such as control flow, you could still specify
a different compiler for each backend since the graph representation is
framework-agnostic. Hell, you could even write, without too much effort, an
edward2, pymc3 or pyro compiler!</p>
<pre><code>Example with control flow and different
</code></pre><p>Is it crazy to do AST manipulation? It might be harder to do it right than in
language with a full-fledged macro system such as, say, Julia or Lisp, but done
correctly it actually gives us nice benefits: a nice API with a powerful
intermediate representation. Corner cases can also be tested as it is possible
to output the code of the logpdfs from the model.</p>
<pre><code>Example model.source_logpdf
</code></pre><h1 id="inference">Inference</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never repeat enough: the modeling language and the inference module are
completely separate. But they need</p>
<p>The philosophy is that inference in traditional PPLs can be divided according to
three different levels of abstraction:</p>
<ol>
<li>The building blocks (or routines) of the algorithms: integrators, metrics, proposals, &hellip;
which do only one thing and do it well.</li>
<li>Programs like the HMC algorithm are a particular assembly of these building
blocks. They form a transition kernel.</li>
<li>Runtimes, that tie the data, the model and the kernel together and then make
the chains move forward following an execution plan.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Runtime (Batch sampler)
-------------------------------------------------
Programs (HMC)
-------------------------------------------------
Routines (velocity Verlet, dynamic proposal, etc.)
-------------------------------------------------
</code></pre><p>Most users will interact with the pre-defined programs (HMC or NUTS with the
Stan warmup) and runtimes. But it is possible to create custom inference, it can
be as simple as overriding HMC&rsquo;s warmup by subclassing its class, or as
complicated as implementing your own transition kernel using the available
blocks or blocks you have programmed.</p>
<p>MCX comes with sane defaults (runtimes and pre-defined programs), but has many
trap doors that allow you to tinker with the lower level.</p>
<p>Note: the lower-level routines are being moved to blackjax.</p>
