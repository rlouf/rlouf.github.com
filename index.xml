 I am a Bayesian at heart. I have been using Bayesian methods professionally for 5 years now; I do not claim to be an expert in the field, and there are a lot of people smarter than me who have been thinking about these problems for a lot longer than I have.  A traditional program may look like this:
Where there&#39;s improvement  Make use of multi-core computations / GPU computation Bayesian knowledge updating Mini-batch updates  P(\theta|\mathcal{D}_1) = \frac{\P(\mathcal{D}_1|\theta) P(\theta)}{P(\mathcal{D}_1} \propto P(\mathcal{D}_1|\theta) Much of the practical &amp;amp; theoretical debate has been focusing on the choice of priors, which for me is a non-debate.</description>
